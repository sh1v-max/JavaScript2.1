## Synchronous vs Asynchronous Requests
In the context of `XMLHttpRequest`, **asynchronous** means that the request is sent to the server **without blocking the rest of your code** from executing. This allows the browser to continue processing other tasks (such as responding to user input or rendering the page) while waiting for the server to send back the response.

#### **1. Synchronous (Blocking) Requests**

In a **synchronous** request, the code execution **halts** at the point where the request is made, and nothing else happens until the server has responded.

**Example (Synchronous Request):**

```javascript
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', 'https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random', false); // false makes it synchronous
xhr.send();

console.log('This will not print until the request completes.');

if (xhr.status === 200) {
  console.log('Response:', xhr.responseText);
}
```

- In the example above, the code execution stops at `xhr.send()` until the server responds. The message `"This will not print until the request completes."` will not appear in the console until the server sends a response and the `xhr` object completes the request.
- During this time, the user is unable to interact with the page. The page is essentially **frozen** until the request is finished.

#### **2. Asynchronous (Non-blocking) Requests**

In an **asynchronous** request, the code continues executing without waiting for the request to complete. The request is sent to the server in the background, and the server’s response is handled when it’s ready—without freezing the page or blocking any further code execution.

**Example (Asynchronous Request):**

```javascript
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', 'https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random', true); // true makes it asynchronous

xhr.onload = function() {
  if (xhr.status === 200) {
    console.log('Response:', xhr.responseText);
  }
};

xhr.onerror = function() {
  console.error('Network error');
};

xhr.send();

console.log('This will print immediately after sending the request.');
```

- Here, when `xhr.send()` is called, the request is sent **in the background** and the browser doesn't wait for it to finish.
- **The message** `"This will print immediately after sending the request."` will appear in the console **immediately** because the browser doesn't stop to wait for the server’s response.
- Once the server responds, the `onload` callback is triggered to process the response.

### Why Asynchronous is Important

- **Better User Experience**: Since the browser doesn’t stop to wait for the server’s response, the page remains interactive. For example, a user can continue to click buttons, scroll, or type while the data is being loaded in the background.
- **Efficient Use of Resources**: The browser can perform other tasks (like rendering the page, handling user input, etc.) while waiting for the server response, making the application feel more responsive and faster.
- **Real-Time Updates**: This is how AJAX works—your page can dynamically update its content without reloading the entire page. For example, fetching new data from the server and updating a list, without reloading the page.

### **In Summary:**

- **Synchronous (blocking)**: The request **blocks** other actions from happening until it completes (the code execution stops).
- **Asynchronous (non-blocking)**: The request is sent **in the background**, and the code continues running, allowing the page to remain interactive.

When we say `XMLHttpRequest` is asynchronous, it means the request happens **in the background** without stopping the execution of other tasks on the web page. This enables **non-blocking** operations that create a smoother experience for the user.
