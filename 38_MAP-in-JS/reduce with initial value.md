The difference in behavior when using `reduce()` with and without an initial value (like `54` in your example) is key to understanding this.

### Scenario 1: **With Initial Value (`54`)**

```javascript
const nums = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1];
const reduced = nums.reduce((accumulator, currentValue, index, array) => {
  console.log(currentValue);
}, 54);
```

- **Explanation**: 
  - When you provide an initial value (`54` in this case), the `reduce()` function starts the accumulation process with that initial value.
  - So, on the first iteration, the accumulator is `54`, and `currentValue` is `1` (the first element of the array). That's why it logs all elements of the array (`1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1`) as the process starts from the first item.

### Scenario 2: **Without Initial Value**

```javascript
const nums = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1];
const reduced = nums.reduce((accumulator, currentValue, index, array) => {
  console.log(currentValue);
});
```

- **Explanation**: 
  - When you **don't provide an initial value**, the `reduce()` method automatically takes the **first element** of the array as the initial value of the accumulator.
  - This means the process skips the first item and begins from the **second element** of the array. The `currentValue` in the first iteration is `1` (the second element), which is why it logs `1, 2, 1, 1, 1` (starting from the second element).

### Summary:
- **With initial value**: `reduce()` starts from the first element (`nums[0]`) and uses the initial value in the accumulator.
- **Without initial value**: `reduce()` skips the first element, using it as the initial accumulator value and starts iterating from the second element (`nums[1]`).

That's why you're seeing different outputs based on whether or not an initial value is provided.
