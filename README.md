## What is Programming?

Programming is the process of designing, writing, testing, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. This source code is written in one or more programming languages, which are used to communicate with a computer and instruct it to perform specific tasks.

## Basic of Programming

* **Variables**: A variable is a named container that stores a value. Variables are used to store and manipulate data in a program.
* **Data Types**: A data type is a classification of data which determines the type of value a variable can store. Common data types include numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, etc.
* **Operators**: Operators are symbols used to perform operations on data. Examples of operators include arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /), comparison operators (==, !=, >, <), logical operators (&&, ||, !), etc.
* **Control Structures**: Control structures are used to control the flow of a program's execution. Examples of control structures include if/else statements, switch statements, for loops, while loops, etc.
* **Functions**: A function is a block of code that can be called multiple times from different parts of a program. Functions can take arguments and return values.
* **Objects**: An object is a data structure that contains key-value pairs. Objects are used to represent complex data and to group related data and functions together.
* **Arrays**: An array is a data structure that contains a list of elements. Arrays are used to store and manipulate collections of data.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language that is used for client-side scripting on the web. It is a prototype-based language, which means that it does not have classes in the classical sense, but it does have objects and prototypes.

JavaScript is a descendant of the Self programming language, and it was influenced by other languages such as C, Java, Perl, and Python.

JavaScript is often used to add interactivity to web pages, such as animations, drag-and-drop functionality, and form validation. It is also used for developing desktop and mobile applications, as well as server-side programming with technologies such as Node.js.

### History of JavaScript

JavaScript was first released in 1995 by Netscape Communications, and it was originally called Mocha. It was later renamed to JavaScript in 1996, and it was released as a part of Netscape Navigator 2.0.

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich, who was a Netscape engineer at the time. He wanted to create a language that was easy to use and could be used to add interactivity to web pages.

In 1997, JavaScript 1.1 was released, and it added support for exception handling and regular expressions.

In 1998, JavaScript 1.2 was released, and it added support for switch statements and try...finally blocks.

In 1999, JavaScript 1.3 was released, and it added support for conditional comments and the for...in loop.

In 2000, JavaScript 1.4 was released, and it added support for the Array.prototype.forEach() method and the Function.prototype.call() method.

In 2005, JavaScript 1.5 was released, and it added support for the Array.prototype.map() and Array.prototype.filter() methods.

In 2009, JavaScript 1.6 was released, and it added support for the String.prototype.trim() method and the Object.keys() method.

In 2011, JavaScript 1.7 was released, and it added support for the let keyword and the destructuring assignment.

In 2015, JavaScript 2015 (also known as ES6) was released, and it added support for classes, promises, generators, and many other features.

In 2016, JavaScript 2016 (also known as ES7) was released, and it added support for the Array.prototype.includes() method and the exponentiation operator (**).

In 2017, JavaScript 2017 (also known as ES8) was released, and it added support for the Object.values() and Object.entries() methods.

In 2018, JavaScript 2018 (also known as ES9) was released, and it added support for the Async/Await syntax and the Promise.prototype.finally() method.
