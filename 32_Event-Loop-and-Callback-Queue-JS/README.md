# Detailed Explanation of Event Loop and Callback Queue in JavaScript

## 1. The Event Loop

The **event loop** is the heart of JavaScript’s asynchronous programming model, ensuring the execution of code without blocking. It allows JavaScript to handle tasks like user input, network requests, and timers, even though it is single-threaded.

### How It Works:
- JavaScript has a **call stack** where function calls are executed. Each function call creates a new frame on the stack.
- If the stack is empty, the event loop looks at the **callback queue** for tasks waiting to be executed.
- The event loop’s job is to continuously check both the **call stack** and the **callback queue**, processing tasks in the appropriate order.

### Visual Representation:
```plaintext
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|                    Call Stack                         |
| (Functions currently being executed)                  |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
                           ↓
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|                  Event Loop                           |
| (Manages the interaction between the queues and stack)|
+-------------------------------------------------------+
                           ↓
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|                    Callback Queue                     |
| (Functions waiting for execution after async tasks)   |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Call Stack Example:
```js
console.log("A");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("C");
}, 2000);

console.log("B");
```

- Output:
  ```
  A
  B
  C (after 2 seconds)
  ```

1. **"A"** is printed first because `console.log("A")` is at the top of the stack.
2. `setTimeout` schedules a task in the **callback queue** after 2 seconds.
3. **"B"** is printed next because it follows in the call stack.
4. After 2 seconds, **"C"** is executed from the **callback queue**.

## 2. Callback Queue (Task Queue)

The **callback queue** (also called the **task queue**) holds the functions waiting to be executed after asynchronous operations like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, or DOM events. Functions are moved to the callback queue after the async task completes, but are only executed when the call stack is empty.

### Callback Queue Example:
```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inside setTimeout");
}, 1000);

console.log("End");
```

- Output:
  ```
  Start
  End
  Inside setTimeout (after 1 second)
  ```

1. The first two `console.log` statements are executed immediately as they are on the call stack.
2. The `setTimeout` callback waits in the callback queue and is executed after 1 second, once the call stack is empty.

## 3. Microtask Queue

In addition to the callback queue, JavaScript has a **microtask queue**, where tasks like promises (`Promise.then()`) are queued. The **microtask queue** has higher priority than the **callback queue**, meaning tasks in the microtask queue are executed before tasks in the callback queue, even if they are queued later.

### Microtask Queue Example:
```js
console.log("Start");

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Promise resolved");
});

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout");
}, 0);

console.log("End");
```

- Output:
  ```
  Start
  End
  Promise resolved
  Timeout
  ```

Explanation:
1. **Start** and **End** are printed immediately.
2. The **Promise** is placed in the **microtask queue**, and once the call stack is empty, it is executed before the `setTimeout` callback in the **callback queue**.

## 4. Interaction Between Call Stack, Event Loop, and Queues

### Steps:
1. **Call Stack**: The call stack holds synchronous code. When the stack is empty, the event loop takes over.
2. **Microtask Queue**: The event loop first checks if the microtask queue has tasks. If yes, they are executed before moving to the callback queue.
3. **Callback Queue**: Once all tasks in the microtask queue are processed, the event loop processes tasks in the callback queue.

### Visualizing the Flow:
```plaintext
1. Function calls -> Call Stack
2. Async tasks -> Callback Queue
3. Promises -> Microtask Queue
4. Event loop -> Moves tasks to Call Stack when it's empty
```

## 5. Nested `setTimeout` vs `setInterval`

Using `setTimeout` recursively (nested `setTimeout`) allows for more precise intervals as compared to `setInterval`, which may have delays due to the time taken to execute the code.

### Example of Nested `setTimeout`:
```js
function repeat() {
  console.log("Repeated with precise interval");
  setTimeout(repeat, 1000);
}

setTimeout(repeat, 1000);
```

## 6. Summary

- **Event Loop**: Continuously checks the call stack and queues to determine what should be executed next.
- **Callback Queue**: Holds asynchronous tasks like `setTimeout` and `setInterval` until the stack is empty.
- **Microtask Queue**: Has higher priority over the callback queue and processes promise-based tasks.
