When comparing **immediately invoked functions** vs. **returning a function**, the primary difference is **when** and **how** the function is executed.

### 1. **Immediately Invoked Function**
An **immediately invoked function** (IIFE) is a function that is executed right after it is defined. As soon as the function is encountered in the code, it is invoked and executed.

#### Example:
```javascript
function parent() {
    function add() {
        console.log(a + b);
    }
    return add(); // Immediately invokes 'add' function
}
```

In this case:
- When `parent()` is called, it immediately calls `add()` and executes the logic inside `add()`.
- The return value of `parent()` is whatever `add()` returns (in this case, `undefined` since `add()` has no return statement).
- **No further control**: You cannot execute `add()` later; it’s invoked right when `parent()` is executed.

#### When to use:
- When you need to execute the inner function **immediately** after its declaration.
- Typically useful for **initialization logic** or **one-time tasks** that don't need to be repeated.

### 2. **Returning the Function**
When a function is returned from another function, it is not invoked immediately. Instead, the **function itself** is returned, and you can invoke it later when needed.

#### Example:
```javascript
function parent() {
    function add() {
        console.log(a + b);
    }
    return add; // Returns 'add' function without invoking it
}
```

In this case:
- `parent()` returns a reference to the `add()` function, without executing it.
- You can store the returned function in a variable and invoke it later:
  ```javascript
  let myAdd = parent(); // 'myAdd' now holds the 'add' function
  myAdd(); // Now you can call 'add' when needed
  ```

#### When to use:
- When you want to **delay execution** of the function until a later point.
- Useful for **function factories** where you return a function to be used in a different context or when the function’s environment is needed later (closures).

### **Comparison**

| Aspect                            | Immediately Invoked                      | Returning the Function                       |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Execution Time**                 | Executed as soon as it is defined        | Executed later, when called explicitly       |
| **Result**                         | Executes immediately, returns the result | Returns the function itself (function reference) |
| **Use Case**                       | One-time tasks, initialization           | Delayed execution, closures, function factories |
| **Example Scenario**               | Initialize a variable or log immediately | Create functions with custom behavior        |

### Conclusion:
- **Immediately invoked functions** are great for one-off tasks or when you need something to run immediately.
- **Returning functions** gives you flexibility to execute the returned function later, making it ideal for scenarios where the function needs to be reused or executed conditionally.

In JavaScript, both techniques serve different purposes and are crucial in building more advanced patterns like **closures**, **higher-order functions**, and **function factories**.
