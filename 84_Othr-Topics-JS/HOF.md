# Higher-Order Functions (HOF) in JavaScript

In JavaScript, **Higher-Order Functions (HOFs)** are functions that **take other functions as arguments** or **return functions as their results**. They are a key concept in functional programming and allow for cleaner, more reusable, and modular code.

## What is a Higher-Order Function?

A **Higher-Order Function** is a function that:
1. **Takes another function as an argument (a callback function)**.
2. **Returns a function** as its result.

Higher-order functions enable developers to write more **abstract**, **clean**, and **reusable** code.



## Why Use Higher-Order Functions?

Higher-order functions are powerful because they:
- **Improve Code Reusability**: Functions can be reused as arguments.
- **Enable Functional Programming**: Concepts like map, filter, and reduce simplify data operations.
- **Make Code Concise and Readable**: Reduce repetitive logic.
- **Encourage Modularity**: Smaller functions are composed into larger, more powerful logic.


## Common Higher-Order Functions

JavaScript comes with built-in higher-order functions for arrays and functional programming.

### 1. `map()`
- **Purpose**: Transforms each element in an array and returns a new array.
- **Takes**: A callback function.

Example:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
```



### 2. `filter()`
- **Purpose**: Filters elements of an array based on a condition.
- **Takes**: A callback function that returns `true` or `false`.

Example:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const even = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(even); // [2, 4]
```



### 3. `reduce()`
- **Purpose**: Reduces an array to a single value by applying a callback.
- **Takes**: A callback function and an optional initial value.

Example:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue, 0);
console.log(sum); // 10
```


### 4. `forEach()`
- **Purpose**: Iterates through each element in an array.
- **Takes**: A callback function.
- **Note**: It does not return a new array.

Example:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.forEach(num => console.log(num * 2)); // 2, 4, 6
```


### 5. `find()`
- **Purpose**: Finds the first element that satisfies the condition.
- **Takes**: A callback function.

Example:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const found = numbers.find(num => num > 2);
console.log(found); // 3
```


## Example of HOFs

Here is an example of using multiple higher-order functions together:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Combine `filter` and `map`
const result = numbers
  .filter(num => num % 2 === 0) // Filter even numbers
  .map(num => num * 2);         // Double the numbers

console.log(result); // [4, 8]
```

## Custom Higher-Order Functions

You can also create your own higher-order functions. Here's an example:

### A Custom Function to Repeat a Task
```javascript
function repeatTask(task, times) {
  for (let i = 0; i < times; i++) {
    task(i);
  }
}

// Pass a callback function
repeatTask(index => {
  console.log(`This is call number ${index + 1}`);
}, 3);
```

**Output**:
```
This is call number 1
This is call number 2
This is call number 3
```



## Advantages of HOFs

1. **Code Reusability**: Reuse generic functions like `map()`, `filter()`, or custom HOFs.
2. **Modularity**: Break code into smaller, manageable parts.
3. **Improved Readability**: Complex operations can be expressed clearly.
4. **Functional Programming**: Encourages pure functions and immutability.


## Conclusion

Higher-order functions (HOFs) are essential to writing cleaner and more efficient JavaScript code. By understanding and using built-in HOFs like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`, or by creating custom higher-order functions, developers can leverage the full power of functional programming in JavaScript.
