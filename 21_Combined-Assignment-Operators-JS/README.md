# Combined Assignment Operators in JavaScript

Combined assignment operators simplify writing operations that involve a variable and a value.

## 1. Addition Assignment (`+=`)
Adds a value to the variable.

```js
let x = 5;
x += 3;  // Equivalent to: x = x + 3
console.log(x);  // 8
```

## 2. Subtraction Assignment (`-=`)
Subtracts a value from the variable.

```js
x -= 2;  // Equivalent to: x = x - 2
```

## 3. Multiplication Assignment (`*=`)
Multiplies the variable by a value.

```js
x *= 2;  // Equivalent to: x = x * 2
```

## 4. Division Assignment (`/=`)
Divides the variable by a value.

```js
x /= 2;  // Equivalent to: x = x / 2
```

## 5. Modulus Assignment (`%=`)
Calculates the remainder of dividing the variable by a value.

```js
x %= 2;  // Equivalent to: x = x % 2
```

## 6. Exponentiation Assignment (`**=`)
Raises the variable to the power of a value.

```js
x **= 3;  // Equivalent to: x = x ** 3
```

## 7. Bitwise Operators
- **AND Assignment (`&=`)**: `x &= y`
- **OR Assignment (`|=`)**: `x |= y`
- **XOR Assignment (`^=`)**: `x ^= y`

These operators combine bitwise operations with assignment.

## 8. Increment and Decrement Operators in JavaScript

### 1. Increment Operator (`++`)

The increment operator increases a variable's value by **1**.

- **Post-increment**: Returns the value first, then increments.
  
```js
let x = 5;
console.log(x++);  // Outputs: 5, then x becomes 6
```

- **Pre-increment**: Increments first, then returns the new value.

```js
console.log(++x);  // Outputs: 7
```

### 2. Decrement Operator (`--`)

The decrement operator decreases a variable's value by **1**.

- **Post-decrement**: Returns the value first, then decrements.
  
```js
console.log(x--);  // Outputs: 7, then x becomes 6
```

- **Pre-decrement**: Decrements first, then returns the new value.

```js
console.log(--x);  // Outputs: 5
```
